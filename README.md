# README

This is a simple message app that i made during a Ruby course.

In this project i used:

* Ruby 3;

* Rails 7;

* Semantic-UI (Using JQuery along with Turbo);

The messages board are using ActionCable websocket for real-time actualization.

Any tips or suggestions, just send me a message.
